# LeetCode-Solutions

This repository contains well-documented solutions for a variety of programming problems from the online judge: [LeetCode.com](https://leetcode.com). 

This repository was intially created for friends of mine who wished to see my solutions to coding problems. Most problems are done in both Python3 and Java. These problems were done as a means of developing my algorithmic and data structures knowledge, as well as in preparation for technical interviews.
